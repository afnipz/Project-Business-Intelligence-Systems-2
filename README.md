Bank Customer Loyalty Prediction Using Random Forest Classification for Marketing Strategy Optimization

# Project Overview
This repository contains our team's first project for the Business Intelligence Systems course, focusing on Customer Relationship Management (CRM). We developed a predictive model using Random Forest Classification to analyze and predict bank customer loyalty, aiming to optimize marketing strategies.

# Key Findings
1. Overall model accuracy: 84.32%
2. Key loyalty indicators identified:
    - Age: Customers ≤44.5 years show higher loyalty
    - Product ownership: Multiple products indicate stronger retention
    - Income levels: Higher income correlates with loyalty
    - Account balance: Important factor, especially for older customers

# Methodology
1. Implemented Random Forest Classification algorithm
2. Analyzed multiple customer attributes including:
    - Age demographics
    - Product usage patterns
    - Annual income
    - Account balances
3. Developed targeted marketing recommendations based on predictive insights

# Key Insights & Recommendations
1. Age-based Targeting: Younger customers (≤44.5 years) show higher loyalty potential
2. Product Strategy: Focus on increasing product adoption to reduce churn risk
3. Balance-based Initiatives: Develop specific programs for customers with lower balances
4. Improvement Areas: Model shows strong performance in predicting loyal customers, with potential for enhanced churn prediction

# Future Development
1. Add relevant attributes to improve model accuracy
2. Optimize data distribution
3. Explore alternative algorithms for better churn prediction
4. Enhance marketing strategy based on continuous data analysis
