E-Commerce Product Segmentation Analysis Using K-Means Clustering
# Project Overview
This repository contains our first project for the Business Intelligence Systems course, focusing on E-Commerce and Marketing analysis. The project implements K-Means Clustering to analyze and segment e-commerce product data, providing valuable insights for business decision-making.
# Key Findings
Our analysis successfully identified three distinct product segments:
1. Affordable Segment: High-volume products with competitive pricing, targeting the mass market
2. Mid-Range Segment: Products balancing price and quality, appealing to selective consumers
3. Premium Segment: High-priced products requiring customer satisfaction improvements

# Methodology
1. Applied K-Means Clustering algorithm to segment e-commerce products
2. Analyzed customer purchasing behavior across different price points
3. Evaluated product performance metrics within each cluster
4. Developed targeted marketing recommendations based on segment characteristics

# Conclusions
The research demonstrates the effectiveness of K-Means Clustering in e-commerce product segmentation. Key recommendations include:
1. Implementing aggressive promotional strategies for affordable products
2. Developing value-based approaches for mid-range products
3. Enhancing quality standards for premium products
